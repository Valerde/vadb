# vadb
vadb is an in-memory K-V database similar to redis, used for self-learning, and coded by myself. 
The difference is that this database will be a single application, 
An interesting thing I want to implement is that I will code all the Java collection class by myself, 
from interface to class independent implementation

# version list
